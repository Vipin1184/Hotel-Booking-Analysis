It also contain details about their arrival time and booking time. And it have details about their booking preferrences like room type. It also have details about thier special requests like space for car parking and meal etc.EDA contains data reading, data cleaning, univariate/bivariate analysis and data visualisations. By performing these steps we will know about patterns regarding booking.And lastly we have to list our insights and conclusion."

What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings."
